CPSC 120
Lab 5

Lab 5, part one was a favorite because we got to deal with making mad libs in class. 
I was alwaays curious about making such games through using strings and other means.
Being able to combine things like IF statements and std cout/string staements.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  std::vector<std::string> arguments(argv, argv + argc);

  if (arguments.size() != 4) {
    std::cout << "error: you must supply three arguments"
              << "\n";
    return 1;
  }

  std::string protein{arguments.at(1)};
  std::string bread{arguments.at(2)};
  std::string condiment{arguments.at(3)};

  std::cout << "Your order:"
            << "\n";
  std::cout << "A " << protein << " sandwich on " << bread << " with "
            << condiment << "."
            << "\n";

  return 0;
}
